Its potential is tied to rising uranium prices and successful project execution. While it offers significant upside if the Kayelekera project is brought online efficiently amidst strong uranium demand, it is also subject to development risks, commodity price volatility, and geopolitical factors in Malawi, making it suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What drives LOT's share price?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"LOT's share price is primarily driven by global uranium spot and long-term contract prices, as these directly impact the future profitability of its Kayelekera project.

Broader market sentiment towards nuclear energy and the overall materials sector on the ASX can also play a role."}}]}6:["ticker","LOT","d"]
