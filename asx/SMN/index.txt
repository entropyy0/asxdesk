Its CVM™ technology has significant disruptive potential in structural health monitoring, particularly in aerospace. However, the company faces substantial commercialization hurdles, including lengthy certification processes and securing major OEM contracts.

This includes positive updates on regulatory certifications (e.g., FAA, EASA approvals for CVM™ applications), successful completion of pilot programs or trials with major aerospace manufacturers, securing significant commercial contracts, and advancements in intellectual property. Share price can also be impacted by capital raising activities, which, while necessary for growth, can dilute existing shareholders."}}]}6:["ticker","SMN","d"]
