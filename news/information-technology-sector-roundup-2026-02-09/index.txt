Other significant movers included 3D Printing Group (ASX: 3DP), which fell -4.2%, and 5G Networks (ASX: 5GN), experiencing an -8.0% drop.

Prevailing macroeconomic headwinds, including investor caution driven by potential interest rate movements, typically impact growth-oriented sectors like IT more severely due to their valuation models. The broader market's significant decline recently created a challenging environment, where tech stocks, often seen as higher-beta assets, bore the brunt. Furthermore, the anticipation of an upcoming 'wild' earnings season has injected considerable uncertainty, with investors awaiting concrete financial results and forward guidance before committing capital."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Looking ahead, the immediate outlook for the ASX Information Technology sector remains complex. While the broader ASX is expected to open higher on Monday, suggesting a potential market rebound, fund managers maintain a cautious stance. The earnings season will be a critical turning point, offering vital insights into the fundamental health and future prospects of companies. Investors will be keenly watching results and forward-looking statements from sector bellwethers and notable movers like APX, WBT, and 360 to gauge the sector's resilience and potential for recovery in what continues to be a volatile trading environment."}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"space-y-4","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-display text-xl font-semibold
