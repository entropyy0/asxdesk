Companies with higher growth expectations or those sensitive to discretionary spending may have been particularly impacted, as market participants re-evaluated valuations amidst the current volatility."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Looking ahead, the Health Care sector's outlook remains a mixed bag. Despite the recent declines, the fundamental demand for healthcare services and innovation persists, potentially offering long-term resilience. However, the immediate future may see continued volatility, especially if the broader market remains under pressure. Savvy investors might seek out contrarian opportunities within the sector, as some fundamentally strong companies could be oversold, but a clear path to recovery will depend on a stabilisation of
