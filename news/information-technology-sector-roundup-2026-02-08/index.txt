This downturn was part of a larger market rout that saw the ASX tumble 1.9%, marking its biggest sell-off in recent times. Individual tech stocks felt the brunt of this pressure, with notable movers including Appen (APX) plummeting -17.2%, Weebit Nano (WBT) down -5.7%, 360 Capital Group (360) falling -3.4%, 3D Products (3DP) losing -4.2%, and 5G Networks (5GN) shedding -8.0%. The broad-based nature of these declines underscores a significant withdrawal of capital from the growth-oriented tech space."}],["$","p","1",{"children":"Several key drivers contributed to the tech sector's poor performance. The recent 'market rout' wiped more than $60 billion from the ASX, creating an environment of widespread risk aversion. This local market turmoil was exacerbated by 'extended tech selling pressure in New York', indicating a global shift away from high-growth tech stocks. With 2025 already described as 'volatile for Australian share investors', the current macroeconomic climate and rising interest rate concerns appear to be prompting a reallocation of funds, hitting particularly hard at small and micro-cap tech stocks that often rely on future growth potential rather than immediate profitability. Announcements from companies on February 6, 2026, failed to stem the tide of negative sentiment."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Looking ahead, the immediate outlook for the Information Technology sector remains challenging amidst continued market volatility and investor caution. The current environment, however, could also present 'contrarian stock opportunities in 2026' for investors willing to weather short-term fluctuations and identify fundamentally sound companies now trading at depressed valuations. While the broader market sentiment against tech may persist in the near term, the long-term thematic tailwinds for digital transformation and technological innovation remain intact. Selective investors may begin to eye quality tech names that have been indiscriminately sold off, but a sustained recovery will likely depend on a stabilisation of global market conditions and a clearer economic trajectory."}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"space-y-4","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-display text-xl font-semibold text-white","children":"Related
